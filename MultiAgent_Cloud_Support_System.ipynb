        "This project showcases an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using CrewAI agents to simulate an AI-powered technical support workflow. The goal is to provide users with accurate, contextual, and well-structured responses based on two available cloud documentation sources: Azure and AWS.\n",
        "\n",
        "The support system is composed of three collaborating agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Router Agent – Interprets the user's query and intelligently selects the appropriate cloud documentation source (Azure or AWS).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Senior Support Agent – Searches through the selected documentation to extract relevant information and draft a response with the required steps or guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Senior Support Quality Assurance Specialist Agent – Reviews the response for completeness, clarity, and accuracy. It then reformats the response into a well-structured format resembling an email (although no actual email is sent).\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup simulates a real-world technical support workflow with modular, human-like reasoning and communication capabilities enabled through multi-agent collaboration."
